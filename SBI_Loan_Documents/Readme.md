### Few Pointers from [Hrishikesh Mohan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrishikesh-mohan-k-p-04193116/)

**1.** Open a General Savings Bank account in any SBI branch as soon as possible, if not having one already. 
<br/>**2.** If you already have an account, mention that in the loan appln (even if not used for a long time).
<br/>**2.** Insurance is not compulsory. It is just for Bank's target. If you want to invest, go ahead.
<br/>**3.** Vidyalakshmi portal login may be required, but don't bother unless SBI people ask you to apply in it.
<br/>**4.** Highly recommended to apply loan from SBI Joka branch for best interest rate and flexible conditions.
<br/>**5.** People with single income families planning to live off their savings, do apply maximum loan amount (including maximum living expenses). 
<br/>**6.** It may be possible to claim the initial deposit of â‚¹ 2 lakhs also. Laptop cost may also be a part of the loan amount.
<br/>**7.** It is suggested that the scan copy of the application with the relevant attachments (KYC, payslips,admit letter etc) be sent by mail to the branch at the earliest.
<br/>**7.** No Co-Applicant required for the loan, no mortgage as well.
<br/>**8.** Interest rate is floating and diminishing. No prepayment penalty. You'll have to pay back only the availed amount, not the sanctioned amount
